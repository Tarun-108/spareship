# Ode2Code 3.0
Developed an automated Spare Part Planning, Visibility, and Assignment tool (Mobile and PC) for aftersales
stakeholders which include Planning, Warehouse, Service Centres, and Customer Support teams. The tool
will help capture the spare parts requirements for each service center and prepare a summarized material
dispatch plan for the spare part planning team, warehouse team, and customer support team.

   - Check part availability across WHs in India
   - Prepare a material dispatch plan and share it with the Warehouse team
4) Warehouse Team
